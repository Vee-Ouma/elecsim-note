Live experimentation of physical processes is often not practical. The costs of real life experimentation can be prohibitively high, and it normally requires significant time in order to fully ascertain the long-term trends. There is also a risk that changes can have detrimental impacts, and therefore often leads to only minor tweaks being made ~\cite{Forshaw2016}. These factors are particularly true for an electricity market, where decisions made can have long term impacts on energy mix, carbon emissions and investment decisions, with energy plants often having a lifetime of 25 years.  A solution to this is simulation, which can be used for rapid testing and prototyping of ideas. Simulation is the substitution of a physical process with a computer model. The computer model is parametrised by real world data and phenomena. The user is then able to experiment using this model, and assess the likelihoods of outcomes under certain scenarios and input variables \cite{Law:603360}.

Electricity energy policy modelling is an example where simulation can be used. Real-life experimentation of energy policy is not always feasible due to the long times required to observe results and high risks associated with setting a sub-optimal policy which could radically alter business models and lead to blackouts in electricity supply. Decisions can have long-term impacts, such as producing an electricity market with many expensive and highly polluting coal power plants, that have ramp-up times that are not suitable to accommodate the intermittent electrical flow of renewables. A number of different simulations and computer models have been used to aid policy makers and energy market developers in coming to informed conclusions:

Energy models can typically be classified as top-down macro-economic models or bottom-up techno-economic models~\cite{Bohringer1998}. Top-down models typically focus on behavioural realism with a focus on macro-economic metrics. They are useful for studying economy-wide responses to policies ~\cite{Hall2016}, for example MARKAL-MACRO \cite{Fishbone1981} and LEAP \cite{Heaps2016}. Bottom-up models represent the energy sector in detail, and are written as mathematical programming problems~\cite{Gargiulo2013}. They detail technology explicitly, and can include cost and emissions implications~\cite{Hall2016}.

It is possible to further categorise bottom-up models into optimisation and simulation models. Optimisation energy models minimise costs or maximise welfare from the perspective of a central planner, for instance a government~\cite{Keles2017}. A use-case would be a government that wants cheap, reliable and a low-carbon electricity supply by a specified date. An optimisation model would find the optimal mix of generators to meet this whilst taking into account the constraints such as space, resources and demand. Examples of optimisation models are MARKAL/TIMES~\cite{Fishbone1981} and MESSAGE~\cite{Schrattenholzer1981}. MARKAL is possibly the most widely used general purpose energy systems model~\cite{Pfenninger2014}.

However, electricity market liberalisation in many Western democracies has changed the framework conditions. Centralised, monopolistic, decision making entities have given way to multiple heterogeneous agents acting in their own best interest~\cite{Most2010}. Therefore, certain policy options which encourage changes must be used by a central planner to attain a desired outcome, for example carbon taxes or subsidies. It is proposed that these complex agents are modelled using agent-based simulation, which allows for the modelling of heterogeneous actors.

Agent-based simulation for electricity markets has received increasing attention in recent years, and a number of simulation tools have emerged, for example SEPIA~\cite{Harp2000} EMCAS~\cite{Conzelmann}, NEMSIM~\cite{Batten2006}, AMES~\cite{Sun2007}, PowerACE~\cite{Rothengatter2007}, ~\cite{Praca2003}, GAPEX~\cite{Cincotti2013} and  EMLab~\cite{Chappin2017}. There are numerous different electricity markets that models can focus on, for example, pool markets, bilateral trading, day-ahead and futures markets.

However, by referring to Table \ref{table:tool_comparison}, it can be seen that none of these suit the needs of an open source, long-term market model. The inclusion of stochastic input variables allows for better performance.

SEPIA \cite{Harp2000} is a discrete event agent based model which utilises Q-learning to model the bids made by GenCos. SEPIA models plants as being always on, and does not have an independent system operator (ISO), which in an electricity market, is an independent non-profit organization for coordinating and controlling of regular operations of the electric power system and market  \cite{Zhou2007}. SEPIA does not model a spot market, instead focusing on bilateral contracts. As opposed to this, ElecSIM has been designed with a merit-order, spot market in mind where renewable energy runs intermittently.

MACSEM \cite{Praca2003} simulates a bilateral and pool market. It has been used to probe the effects of market rules and conditions by simulating and testing different bidding strategies. However, MACSEM does not model long term investment decisions.

EMCAS ~\cite{Conzelmann} is a closed source agent-based framework which investigates the interactions between physical infrastructures and economic behaviour of market participants. ElecSIM, however, focuses on purely the dynamics on the market, with an aim of providing a simplified, transparent, open source model of market operation, whilst maintaining robustness.

PowerACE ~\cite{Rothengatter2007} is also a closed source agent-based simulation of electricity markets that integrates short-term perspectives of daily electricity trading and long-term investment decisions. Similarly to ElecSIM, PowerACE initialises agents with all power plants in their respective country. However, unlike ElecSIM, PowerACE does not take into account stochasticity of price risks in electricity markets which is of crucial importance to real markets~\cite{Most2010}.

EMLab ~\cite{Chappin2017} is also an agent-based modelling toolkit for the electricity market. EMLab models an endogenous European emissions trading scheme with a yearly time-step. However, like PowerACE, EMLab differs from ElecSIM by not taking into account stochasticity in the electricity markets, such as outages, differing fuel prices within a year period and stochasticity in power plant operating costs. However, after correspondence with the authors, we were unable to run EMLab.

AMES ~\cite{Sun2007} is an agent-based model specific to the US Wholesale Power Market Platform. GAPEX \cite{Cincotti2013} is an agent-based framework for modelling and simulating power exchanges in MATLAB . GAPEX utilises an enhanced version of the reinforcement technique Roth-Erev to consider the presence of affine total cost functions. However, neither of these model the long-term dynamics that ElecSIM is designed for.

Table \ref{table:tool_comparison} shows the features of each of the tools reviewed in this section. We propose ElecSIM to fill the gaps that are not currently covered, which includes an open source long-term stochastic investment model.
