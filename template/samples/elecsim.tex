ElecSIM has been designed for ease of use to enable non-experts to rapidly test different policies and the outcome of various scenarios such as demand growth. The user is able to input exogenous variables such as fuel cost, carbon taxes, power plants, power plant costs, electricity demand and availability factors. This allows for the initialisation of different countries and scenarios to be tested.


\subsection{High-Level Overview}

ElecSIM is made up of four fundamental parts: The agents, which are split up into demand and generation company (GenCo) agents. The world in which these agents exist. Power plants which are owned by the GenCo agents, and the Power Exchange which acts as a market to match GenCo owned power plants with electricity demand.

A schematic of ElecSIM is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:system_overview} which shows these four fundamental parts, and how they interact.

\subsubsection{Data parametrisation} To parametrise the world two sources are used. A configuration file and data files. The data files store information such as historical fuel prices, historical plant availability, wind and solar capacity, power plant costs, historical costs, historical efficiency, company finances and historical carbon price. This is data that does not change from scenario to scenario for a country realisation, however does change between country and country.

To ensure rapid changes between scenarios, the configuration file enables the user to rapidly change scenarios, and points to the various previously mentioned data sources. The configuration file enables the changing of demand growth and load duration curve, which is the shape of demand curve over a year period. Future fuel and carbon prices, capital costs, plant availability, investment costs and simulation time. These data is then used to calibrate the world. 

The demand agent is a simplified representation of aggregated demand in a country. Each year it multiplies the percentage of change in demand with the load duration curve. This data is used by the Power Exchange to match supply with demand.

\subsubsection{Generation Companies} The GenCos have two main functions. Investing in power plants and making bids to sell their electricity yearly for each of their power plants. We will first focus on the buying and selling of electricity using a Power Exchange, and then cover the investment algorithm for GenCos.

Figure \ref{fig:powermarket} displays the process for each segment of demand. The Power Exchange receives bids for every single power station in the model world from each of the GenCos The final price paid to each of the GenCos is known as the spot price or the System Marginal Price (SMP). The spot price or SMP is the highest price that has been accepted to meet demand. This is paid to all generators regardless of their initial bid. For this reason, GenCos are motivated to bid their minimum profitable price to ensure that their bid is accepted. This minimum profitable price is known as the short run marginal cost (SRMC). The SRMC is the price that it costs a generator to sell a single unit of electricity.

\subsubsection{Investment}

Investment in power plants is made upon a net present value (NPV) calculation. NPV is a summation of the present value of a series of present and future cash flow. NPV provides a method for evaluating and comparing investments with cash flows spread over many years, making it suited to evaluating power plants which have a long lifetime. NPV is is based upon the fact that current cash flow is worth more than future cash flow. This is due to the fact that money today can be invested and have a rate of return in the future. Meaning that, for example \$50,000 today is worth more than \$50,000

Whilst investment decisions for each GenCo are based on the same algorithm, each GenCo has a slightly different return on investment and risk strategy. Each GenCo differs in the discount rate that they set for investments in power plants. The discount rate is based upon the concept of time value of money. Where money in the present is worth more than money in the future. For example, GenCos may value having money in the present rather than 20 years into the future more than other GenCos. This is down to particular GenCo risk tolerance, strategies and desired return on investment.

The discount rate can be set in the configuration file, and a deviation from this mean is selected for each GenCo based upon a sampling from a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of $\pm3\%$. This distribution was chosen to give sufficient variance between GenCos whilst remaining close to the mean set by the user.



The discount rate refers to the interest rate used in discounted cash flow analysis to determine the present value of future cash flows.


Investment differs for each GenCo based upon their discount rates and the amount of historical data they use to predict future fuel and carbon prices. These two 



%GenCos  invest in power plants based on the highest positive net present value (NPV). Bids are made for each power plant based on the power plants short run marginal cost. A Power Exchange operator matches these bids with demand in merit order. 

This is then repeated for each year of the simulation.

\subsection{Detailed Overview}

ElecSIM is made up of two different agent types, GenCos (Generation Companies) and a Demand agent. GenCos can be initialised by the user. For example, to a desired country, or a toy-example. Each of the GenCos are initialised with their respective power plants. GenCos are given a randomized discount rate, which can be set by the user, around a mean of 10\% for nuclear power plants \cite{Paper2012} and 5.9\% for all other generators \cite{KPMG2017}.





\subsubsection{Data Initialisation}ElecSIM's power generation costs are initialised using the UK government Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) power plant generation report \cite{Department2016}. This contains information such as capital costs and operation and maintenance costs ($F_C$ and $V_C$), including details such as insurance ($In_C$) and connection costs ($Con_C$). Where there are power plants of a size not included in this report, the parameters are linearly interpolated. Where the capacity of a power plant is larger or smaller than the data points in the report, the parameters are extrapolated by using the last known data point.

For historical power plants, we used historical costs of Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) \cite{Dale2013}. Each parameter was scaled linearly from the modern LCOE calculated from the BEIS report, to attain the relevant historical LCOE. This was achieved by using linear optimisation, and therefore each parameter can be changed based on an individual user's country and dataset by modifying the constraints. As well as historical LCOE, historical plant efficiency was taken into account for gas and coal power plants \cite{EIA2013}.

When initialised, the variable operation and maintenance costs are selected from a uniform distribution, with the ability for the user to set maximum and minimum percentage increase from the BEIS report. A uniform distribution was chosen to capture the large deviations that can occur in variation of variable operation and maintenance, especially other a long time period. By doing this, the variance in costs between individual power plants for processes such as preventative and corrective maintenance, labour costs and skill, health and safety and chance are different per plant.  

As per \cite{Chappin2017}, we created a load duration curve of the electricity demand for one year with 20 segments. 20 segments enabled us to capture the varying demand of electricity throughout a year to a high enough degree of accuracy, but also reduce computational complexity. To model the Intermittency of wind and solar power we allow them to contribute only a certain percentage of total capacity for each load segment based on empirical wind and solar capacity factors, relating demand to average capacity \cite{Pfenninger2016, Staffell2016, Chappin2017}. The requirement of storage to provide constant electricity from intermittent resources is an important issue. However, due to the fact that ElecSIM takes yearly time steps, we are unable to model short term variability in electricity demand. We also, do not model long-term storage due to its currently limited ability. 

Whilst fuel price is controlled by the user, there is inherent volatility in fuel price in a single year. To take into account this variability, an ARIMA model was fit to historical gas and coal price data \cite{coalprices,gasprices}. The standard deviation of the residuals was used to model the precise price of fuel that a generation company will buy the fuel in a given year. This takes into account differences in hedging strategies and the process of luck between competing generation companies.

Outages are modelled by using availability data of gas, coal, photovoltaic, offshore and onshore power generators \cite{Ltd2016, Hunt2015, carroll-j}. Plants bid a reduced percentage of their nameplate capacity based on their respective availability. Historical availabilities are modelled for older gas, coal and hydro power plants \cite{AlbertaSystemElectricOperator2016}.

With historical power plants which have been refurbished, we sample their initialisation randomly between 15 years prior to initialisation year and the initialisation year.

Power plants are taken out of service if they have not sold any electricity in the past 7 years. We decided upon this due to the fact that power generators have high, sunk capital costs, which often have high demolition costs. We assume, therefore, that generator companies are willing to wait circa $\frac{1}{4}$ of their lives to see if a pay-out occurs due to the breakdown of competing power plants, increasing demand, or governmental support in the form of a carbon tax increase or reduction.


\subsubsection{Spot Market}

The buying and selling of electricity is modelled as a spot market, where each year, electricity is bought and sold in merit order. GenCos place bids for each of their plants at the respective short run marginal cost. We assume that generator companies do not have market power, however we set the lost load to be \textsterling6000 to encourage investment as per the recommendations of the UK government \cite{DECC2013}.

\subsubsection{Investment}

Investments are made on a yearly basis and are made purely on net present value calculations. The order in which GenCos invest in each simulated year is randomised as to not give certain generation companies an advantage.

Agents have imperfect information, and therefore fuel and carbon prices are predicted using linear regression, with a training period sampled uniformly from the previous 3 to 7 years. This allows us to model heterogeneity of GenCos. Demand is modelled through the use of an exponential function, so that compounded growth can be modelled. However, if a reasonable fit for the training data is not found, a linear regression is used.

GenCos only bid if they have 25\% of the upfront capital costs, with the rest of the capital provided through equity and debt. The cost of equity and debt is modelled as a weighted average cost of capital (WACC), with values of 5.9\% for non-nuclear power plants, and 10\% for nuclear power plants \cite{KPMG2017, Paper2012}. The WACC is used as the discount rate for net present value calculations \cite{KincheloeStephenC1990TWAC}. Each GenCo is initialised with a slightly different discount rate based on a uniform distribution, with a $\pm$3\% standard deviation. This allows us to model the variability in discount rates that GenCos may have, based on different factors such as preference, risk strategies, and readiness for investors and lenders to supply capital.

The sale price of electricity in the future reference year is predicted by each generation company simulating the same merit-order market algorithm that is used for the spot market. They simulate the bids that they expect each of the power plants that are in operation to make, and use the demand predicted to match supply with demand. They then assess whether their investment option is likely to make a profit, ie. with a positive net present value. The power plant with the highest net present value is then invested in.
