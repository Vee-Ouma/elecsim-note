\begin{abstract}

Due to the threat of climate change, a shift from a fossil-fuel based system to one based on renewable energy is required. However, this is not as simple as instantaneously closing down all fossil fuel energy generation and replacing them with renewable sources -- careful decisions need to be taken. To aid decision makers, we present a new tool, ElecSIM, an agent-based modelling framework used to examine the effect of policy on long term investment decisions. We review different techniques currently used to model long term energy decisions, and motivate why agent-based models will become an important strategic tool for policy makers.

We show how modelling stochasticity improves model reliability and motivate why an open-source toolkit is required and demonstrate how ElecSIM meets the requirements of the electricity market. The model runs in yearly time steps, making assumptions based on empirical data on the impact of intermittent renewable energy. We present the dynamics of the system through scenario testing and provide validation. ElecSIM allows non-experts to rapidly prototype new ideas, and is developed around a modular framework -- which allows technical experts to add and remove features at will. 

{\color{red}
This bit seems to be saying "and our work is not complete yet" -- better to say something about the results here (when we have them) and leave the text below for the conclusions.

Future work includes integrating different types of agent based learning for the bidding and investment process, utilising multi-agent reinforcement algorithms that can deal with a non stationary environment. We will use the yearly time-step as a baseline model for integration of a higher temporal and spatial resolution.

\section{Introduction}
ACM's consolidated article template, introduced in 2017, provides a consistent \LaTeX\ style for use across ACM publications, and incorporates accessibility and metadata-extraction functionality necessary for future Digital Library endeavours. Numerous ACM and SIG-specific \LaTeX\ templates have been examined, and their unique features incorporated into this single new template.

If you are new to publishing with ACM, this document is a valuable guide to the process of preparing your work for publication. If you have published with ACM before, this document provides insight and instruction into more recent changes to the article template.

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class can be used to prepare articles for any ACM publication --- conference or journal, and for any stage of publication, from review to final ``camera-ready'' copy, to the author's own version, with {\it very} few changes to the source. 

\section{Template Overview}
As noted in the introduction, the ``\verb|acmart|'' document class can be used to prepare many different kinds of documentation --- a double-blind initial submission of a full-length technical paper, a two-page SIGGRAPH Emerging Technologies abstract, a ``camera-ready'' journal article, a SIGCHI Extended Abstract, and more --- all by selecting the appropriate {\it template style} and {\it template parameters}.

This document will explain the major features of the document class. For further information, the {\it \LaTeX\ User's Guide} is available from \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}.

\subsection{Template Styles}

The primary parameter given to the ``\verb|acmart|'' document class is the {\it template style} which corresponds to the kind of publication or SIG publishing the work. This parameter is enclosed in square brackets and is a part of the {\verb|documentclass|} command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \documentclass[STYLE]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

Journals use one of three template styles. All but three ACM journals use the {\verb|acmsmall|} template style:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\verb|acmsmall|}: The default journal template style.
\item {\verb|acmlarge|}: Used by JOCCH and TAP.
\item {\verb|acmtog|}: Used by TOG.
\end{itemize}

The majority of conference proceedings documentation will use the {\verb|acmconf|} template style.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\verb|acmconf|}: The default proceedings template style.
\item{\verb|sigchi|}: Used for SIGCHI conference articles.
\item{\verb|sigchi-a|}: Used for SIGCHI ``Extended Abstract'' articles.
\item{\verb|sigplan|}: Used for SIGPLAN conference articles.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Template Parameters}

In addition to specifying the {\it template style} to be used in formatting your work, there are a number of {\it template parameters} which modify some part of the applied template style. A complete list of these parameters can be found in the {\it \LaTeX\ User's Guide.}

Frequently-used parameters, or combinations of parameters, include:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\verb|anonymous,review|}: Suitable for a ``double-blind'' conference submission. Anonymizes the work and includes line numbers. Use with the \verb|\acmSubmissionID| command to print the submission's unique ID on each page of the work.
\item{\verb|authorversion|}: Produces a version of the work suitable for posting by the author.
\item{\verb|screen|}: Produces colored hyperlinks.
\end{itemize}

This document uses the following string as the first command in the source file: \verb|\documentclass[sigconf,screen]{acmart}|.

\section{Modifications}

Modifying the template --- including but not limited to: adjusting margins, typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions, and the use of the \verb|\vspace| command to manually adjust the vertical spacing between elements of your work --- is not allowed.

{\bf Your document will be returned to you for revision if modifications are discovered.}

\section{Typefaces}

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class requires the use of the ``Libertine'' typeface family. Your \TeX\ installation should include this set of packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The ``\verb|lmodern|'' and ``\verb|ltimes|'' packages should not be used, as they will override the built-in typeface families.

\section{Title Information}

The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately - \url{https://capitalizemytitle.com/} has useful rules for capitalization. Use the {\verb|title|} command to define the title of your work. If your work has a subtitle, define it with the {\verb|subtitle|} command.
Do not insert line breaks in your title.

If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be used in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The \verb|title| command has a ``short title'' parameter:
\begin{verbatim}
  \title[short title]{full title}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Authors and Affiliations}

Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata identification. Multiple authors may share one affiliation. Authors' names should not be abbreviated; use full first names wherever possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever possible.

Grouping authors' names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ``e-mail alias,'' as shown below, is not acceptable:
\begin{verbatim}
  \author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
  \email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
  \email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}
\end{verbatim}

The \verb|authornote| and \verb|authornotemark| commands allow a note to apply to multiple authors --- for example, if the first two authors of an article contributed equally to the work. 

If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version of the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The following command should be placed just after the last \verb|\author{}| definition:
\begin{verbatim}
  \renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}
\end{verbatim}
Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of all of the authors' names, which may result in overlapping text in the page headers.

The article template's documentation, available at  \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}, has a complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective use.

\section{Rights Information}

Authors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a rights form. Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice made by the author, this may be copyright transfer, permission, license, or an OA (open access) agreement.

Regardless of the rights management choice, the author will receive a copy of the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This form contains \LaTeX\ commands that must be copied into the source document. When the document source is compiled, these commands and their parameters add formatted text to several areas of the final document:
\begin{itemize}
\item the ``ACM Reference Format'' text on the first page.
\item the ``rights management'' text on the first page.
\item the conference information in the page header(s).
\end{itemize}

Rights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing several works for an event, make sure to use the correct set of commands with each of the works.

\section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}

Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online search. 

The ACM Computing Classification System --- \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of classifiers and concepts that describe the computing discipline. Authors can select entries from this classification system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source. 

User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases of the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing the research being presented.

CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for all short- and full-length articles, and optional for two-page abstracts. 

\section{Sectioning Commands}

Your work should use standard \LaTeX\ sectioning commands: \verb|section|, \verb|subsection|, \verb|subsubsection|, and \verb|paragraph|. They should be numbered; do not remove the numbering from the commands. 

Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is {\bf not allowed.}

\section{Tables}

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|'' package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing high-quality tables. 

Table captions are placed {\it above} the table.

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of this document.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
  \label{tab:freq}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
    \midrule
    \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
    $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
    \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
    $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of this document.

\begin{table*}
  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
  \label{tab:commands}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Command &A Number & Comments\\
    \midrule
    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\section{Math Equations}
You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of
the three are discussed in the next sections.

\subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an
inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
\textbf{math} environment, which can be
invoked with the usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end}
construction or with the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You
can use any of the symbols and structures,
from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
this equation:
\begin{math}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
\textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just
give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\section{Figures}

The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown in the example below.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
  \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \& Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
  \Description{The 1907 Franklin Model D roadster.}
\end{figure}

Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to the reader. Figure captions go below the figure. Your figures should {\bf also} include a description suitable for screen readers, to assist the visually-challenged to better understand your work.

Figure captions are placed {\it below} the figure.

\subsection{The ``Teaser Figure''}

A ``teaser figure'' is an image, or set of images in one figure, that are placed after all author and affiliation information, and before the body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a figure in your article, place the command immediately before the \verb|\maketitle| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{teaserfigure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
    \caption{figure caption}
    \Description{figure description}
  \end{teaserfigure}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Citations and Bibliographies}

The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete --- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials (``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages, article DOI, etc. 

The bibliography is included in your source document with these two commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
  \bibliography{bibfile,custom-bibtex}
\end{verbatim}
where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|'' suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.

Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the ``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this command in the {\bf preamble} (before ``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source: 
\begin{verbatim}
  \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
\end{verbatim}

Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
\cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation \cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.),
a chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a divisible book in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as book \cite{Knuth97}, an article in a proceedings (of a conference, symposium, workshop for example) (paginated proceedings article) \cite{Andler79}, a proceedings article with all possible elements \cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated proceedings article \cite{VanGundy07}, an informally published work \cite{Harel78}, a doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85}, a master's thesis: \cite{anisi03}, an online document / world wide web resource \cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07, Poker06}, a video game (Case 1) \cite{Obama08} and (Case 2) \cite{Novak03} and \cite{Lee05} and (Case 3) a patent \cite{JoeScientist001}, work accepted for publication \cite{rous08}, 'YYYYb'-test for prolific author \cite{SaeediMEJ10} and \cite{SaeediJETC10}. Other cites might contain 'duplicate' DOI and URLs (some SIAM articles) \cite{Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Boris / Barbara Beeton: multi-volume works as books \cite{MR781536} and \cite{MR781537}. A couple of citations with DOIs: \cite{2004:ITE:1009386.1010128,Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Online citations: \cite{TUGInstmem, Thornburg01, CTANacmart}.

\section{Acknowledgments}

Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment section, which is placed just before the reference section in your document. 

This section has a special environment:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{acks}
  ...
  \end{acks}
\end{verbatim}
so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure consistency in the spelling of the section heading. 

Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered {\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.

\section{Appendices}

If your work needs an appendix, add it before the ``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source document. 

Start the appendix with the ``\verb|appendix|'' command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \appendix
\end{verbatim}
and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not numbered. This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section and subsection identification method.

\section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}

The ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style (available only in \LaTeX\ and not in Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with a wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with the ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style, and produce formatted output in the margin:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\verb|sidebar|}:  Place formatted text in the margin.
\item {\verb|marginfigure|}: Place a figure in the margin.
\item {\verb|margintable|}: Place a table in the margin.
\end{itemize}

%
% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures
% the proper identification of the section in the article metadata, and the consistent spelling of the heading.
\begin{acks}
To Robert, for the bagels and explaining CMYK and color spaces.
\end{acks}

%
% The next two lines define the bibliography style to be used, and the bibliography file.
\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
\bibliography{library,custombibtex}
