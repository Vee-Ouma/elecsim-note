The shift in electricity markets from a centrally controlled monopoly, to a liberalised market with many heterogeneous players has increased the need for a new type of modelling. We motivate that agent-based models can be used as a solution to this, by modelling many actors with different properties. 

Agent-based models are able to model imperfect information. ElecSIM models imperfect information through forecasting of electricity demand and future fuel and electricity prices. This leads to agents taking risk on their investments, and more realistically models actual market conditions.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Requirement for agent based models based on imperfect information, liberalised energy markets
	\item Requirement for low barriers to entry open source model.
	\item Discuss results
	\item Future work:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Embedding multi-agent intelligence such as Genetic Algorithms,  Q-learning and dynamic reinforcement learning
		\item Raise spatial and temporal resolution.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
