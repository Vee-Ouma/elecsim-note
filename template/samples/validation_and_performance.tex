\begin{itemize}
	\item Validation of model 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Compare price duration curve
		\item Compare power plant costs and NPV calculations
		\item Look number of steps ahead to compare electricity mix and compare to actual (cross-validation)
	\end{itemize} 
	\item Performance metrics - Comparison with EMLab, PowerACE (15 minute run time)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Memory, disk size, runtime
		\item Increase in time complexity with additional data.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
